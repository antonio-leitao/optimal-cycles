#### Usage
Download the repository and install it by running the command in the repository directory.

```shell
pip install .
```
#### Example
Check the `examples` folder for jupyter notebooks with examples.
I recommend the `002_time_label_test.ipynb` that showcases the different optimization criteria for time labels.
